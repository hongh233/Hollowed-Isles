Individual Assignment

Important: How to control the character:
WASD move, space to jump

The Additional Features that I have implemented.
1. Large Map that I construct myself.
I use some free model from assignment assets and unity assets store. But I construst the whole map myself, using some basic element like tree, house, grass, flower, etc. I build a forest mixed with mountain view in level 1, and I build a large building (building island) in level 2, which player will able to take a lot of time explore it.

2. MiniMap
Since I build a large map, the miniMap would be crucial for player to explore the world. I create a camera and a script to control the map. Create a map UI to display what the camera catch on the screen.

3. Animator for character
The character model I used is from free unity asset store. I use the animation clip inside the character model folder to create an animator for control the character animation to move forward, backward, jump, walk left and walk right. So now when player is moving, it can show fluently animation.

4. Different kind of enemies
I have different types of enemies, each with varying attack range, detection range, health, and attack power. Additionally, these enemies have different animations to control their actions, such as displaying an attack animation when attacking and an idle animation when not in action.

5. Clear work tell you your status
Like you are dead, or you will move to the next level, also, an easy task system will tell what you should do to win the game.
